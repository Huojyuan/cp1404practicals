## Lessons I've Learned About Clean Code

- **Meaningful Naming:** Use descriptive and consistent variable and function names to improve readability and maintainability.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Keep your code modular by separating logic into functions with a single, clear responsibility.
- **Consistent Formatting:** Follow standard formatting rules (PEP8), and always use tools like *Reformat Code* in PyCharm to keep code clean and professional.
